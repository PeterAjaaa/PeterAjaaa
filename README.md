## üëã Hi, I'm Peter! 
I'm a self-taught programmer. Well, **future** programmer anyway. Currently, I'm still learning things!

### üí° What's your interest in programming?
Software development has piqued my interest and curiosity from a long time ago! For me, it's just fascinating to be able to build things and to turn ideas into real-world projects!

### ‚úçÔ∏è What languages you're learning on currently?
Currently, I'm learning Python and Rust. There's more to come though! One can never have too much knowledge, right?

### üîé Where can I find you ?
You can find me here!
