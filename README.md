## 👋 Hi, I'm Peter! 
I'm a software developer. Well, **future** software developer anyway. Currently, I'm still learning things!

### 💡 What's your interest in programming?
Software development has piqued my interest and curiosity from a long time ago! For me, it's just fascinating to be able to build things and to turn ideas into real-world projects! I also want to make impact and help those around me using the skills I have, and software development enables me to do exactly that!

### ✍️ What is your current tech stack?
Currently, I'm mainly develop using Python, Rust, and Java. There's more to come though! I'm still learning many new things every day, so stay tuned!
